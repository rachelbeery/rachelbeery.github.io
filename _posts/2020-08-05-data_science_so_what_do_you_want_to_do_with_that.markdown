Upon starting this journey in Data Science and moving back to rural Ohio to visit my family and friends I have been asked many times, "So what exactly is data science?". My text book answer to this is: Data Science is an inter-disciplinary field and tool to understand the world around us by developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to effectively extract useful information. 

Yeah, that isn't really what I tell friends and family when they ask this question. I usually say that data science is using data to understand the world by analyzing that data and utilizing coding and computer science. The conversation that usually happens is:

"Wow, Rachel that sounds like such an interesting program you are starting! Do you know what you are going to do with all of those skills?" 

My response is, "I want a fullfilling job where I can utilize and innovate with the skills I learn to make a positive impact on the world". In the past I have held positions where I have made a positive impact on a personal scale whether it be through teaching about the environment at the Columbus Zoo, helping refugee and immigrant families with finding housing in central Ohio, or leading a team of students in a dancing competition in Malaysia. Through the Data Science program with Flatiron Schools, I want to expand my knowledge and abilities so that I can begin making an impact on a larger scale.

I was first exposed to the applications of data science while conducting research while also mapping 95 villages in Melghat, India. By the time I had left we had created a mapping resource and collected data that will allow the public health organization MAHAN to implement and understand their interventions, programs, and studies that fight malnutrition, substance addiction, infant mortality, poverty, and many other health disparities. 

The applications of data science are endless from uses in the sectors of business, education, economics, political science, and more. In the future I want to continue to do work that like this project can spread knowledge of patterns and phenomenon to organizations and governments that can in turn affect public health outcomes. By harnessing the tools and applications of data science, large amounts of data and unknown issues in the world can be discovered, insights can be made, and innovations can be developed.
