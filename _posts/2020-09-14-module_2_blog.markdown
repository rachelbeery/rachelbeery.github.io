The content of your blog post goes here. In typography, Serifs refer to the small decorative flourishes at the end of strokes. And the word “Sans” means “without” in French. So a sans serif font is one that does not have the small decorative flourishes at the end of strokes. Sans serif fonts are also referred to as Grotesque or Gothic.

Compared to serif fonts that are usually considered traditional and familiar, sans serif fonts are modern and bold. So sans serif fonts are good for headlines and short copy that requires attention. Another feature of sans serif fonts is their less complex shapes, which will make less pixilation and distraction. So it displays well on computers that usually have poor resolution and they are generally the de facto standard for body text online. Helvetica, initially released as Neue Haas Grotesk and designed by Max Miedinger in 1957 is a typical sans serif font family.
